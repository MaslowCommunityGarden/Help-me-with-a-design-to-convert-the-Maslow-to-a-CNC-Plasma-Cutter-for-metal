# Help me with a design to convert the Maslow to a CNC Plasma Cutter for metal

If we replace the mount for the router to instead hold a normal hand held Plasma cutter torch head then we could use the Maslow CNC for cutting all sorts of metals too. There are already similar conversions to turn a hand held plasma cutters into a flatbed plasma cutters driven with computer CNC controls. This design aspect is beyond my capabilities, but I know with help from people much smarter than me in this community that we can turn the Maslow into a CNC plasma cutter as well for a fraction of the price of existing plasma cutting tables. The design part of this project is beyond my skill set, but if there are people willing to help with that part, then I am will to build the prototype and help make their design concepts a reality.
